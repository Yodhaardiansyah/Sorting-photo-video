Program for Sorting Photos, Screenshots, and Videos into Separate Folders
This program is designed to automatically organize image and video files by sorting them into three different folders:

Photos – Stores general image files such as .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .bmp, etc.
Screenshots – Stores screenshot images, typically identified by their filenames (e.g., containing "screenshot" or captured by specific screen capture software).
Videos – Stores video files such as .mp4, .mov, .avi, .mkv, etc.
How It Works
The program scans a specified directory for image and video files.
It checks the file type and, if necessary, the filename to determine if it's a photo, screenshot, or video.
It then moves the file into the appropriate folder.
The process runs automatically, either manually triggered or scheduled at regular intervals.
Use Case
This program is useful for keeping media files organized, reducing clutter, and making it easier to find specific files. It is especially helpful for users who frequently take screenshots or download images and videos.
